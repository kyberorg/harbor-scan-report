# Harbor Scan Report Action
One of fantastic options of [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/) is integrations with different vulnerability scanners. 
They provide list of vulnerabilities found in image. 

This action gets this scan report and makes comment with scan results for given docker image.

Currently, it can comment Pull Requests (PR) and issues.

This action consists from 2 parts:
1. Getting scan report
2. Generating GitHub comment (optional)

## Why it might be useful?

* Your image is stored at [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/)
* Your might want to prevent unsecure images from been deployed

## Examples
* Clean image
![CleanImage](clean-image.png?raw=true)
* Vulnerable image
![VulnerableImage](vulnerable-image.png)

## Configuration
* Minimal valid example
```yaml
- name: Run Report
        uses: kyberorg/harbor-scan-report@v0.1
        with:
          harbor-host: my_harbor.tld
          image: my_harbor.tld/hub/redhat/ubi8:latest
```
* Full example
```yaml
- name: Run Report
        uses: kyberorg/harbor-scan-report@v0.1

          harbor-host: my_harbor.tld
          harbor-proto: http
          harbor-port: 8080
          harbor-robot: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_ROBOT }}
          harbor-token: ${{ secrets.HARBOR_TOKEN }}
          image: my_harbor.tld:8080/hub/redhat/ubi8:latest
          digest: sha256:01814f4b10f321f09244a919d34b0d5706d95624b4c69d75866bb9935a89582d
          timeout: 150
          check-interval: 10
          max-allowed-severity: high
          report-sort-by: score
          github-url: ${{ github.event.pull_request.comments_url }}
